\title{Creates a particle filter (sequential monte carlo) algorithm to estimate the log-likelihood for a model sub-graph}
\usage{
buildPF(model, nodes, silent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A nimble model object, typically representing a state space model or a hidden Markov model}\item{nodes}{A character vector specifying the latent model nodes over which the particle filter will stochastically integrate over to estimate the log-likelihood function}\item{silent}{logical indicating whether to suppress logging information}}\description{
Creates a particle filter (sequential monte carlo) algorithm to estimate the log-likelihood for a model sub-graph
}
\details{
The resulting specialized particle filter algorthm will accept a single integer argument (m, default 10,000), which specifies the number of random \'particles\' to use for estimating the log-likelihood.  The algorithm returns the estimated log-likelihood value.
