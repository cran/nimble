Version 0.5 is the first version one can install directly from CRAN.

You can install the package from CRAN with
  install.packages("nimble")

You can install from the source file using
   R CMD INSTALL nimble_0.5.tar.gz
or
  install.packages("nimble_0.5.tar.gz", repos = NULL)

You can also install the package directly from the NIMBLE repository 
  install.packages("nimble", repos = "http://r-nimble.org/R")

There are two configuration options:  --enable-lib and --with-eigen.
--enable-lib is currently only supported on UNIX/Linux/OS X platforms,
i.e. not Windows.

 --enable-lib=false/true  controls whether we compile the shared C++ code that is used
   across different NIMBLE models as libnimble.so and then use this one copy of the code
   by linking against it. Otherwise, we link this common code into the DLL for each generated 
   model, essentially copying the code.

 --with-eigen=/path/to/dir   - this specifies the full path to a directory containing the 
    header files for the Eigen library. This directory must contain the Eigen/ sub-directory 
    By default, we will use the Eigen distribution included with the package.


We can specify any or all of these with
  R CMD INSTALL nimble_0.5.tar.gz  --configure-args="--enable-lib=false --with-eigen=/Users/duncan/local"
or
  install.packages("nimble", configure.args = "--enable-lib=false --with-eigen=/Users/duncan/local")

Note that if you install on Mac OS X from the source file provided by CRAN, you will need this gfortran package installed: http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2. This version, https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/gfortran-4.2.3.pkg, will NOT work because of path issues. In contrast, if you install from source from r-nimble.org, we leave out $FLIBS from src/Makevars.in so you won't need any gfortran package installed.
